Moodle Block Grade Overview 
===========================
VERSION 1.0
------------
The purpose of the Block Grade Overview plugin is to allow the teacher to set up a personalized overview of the notes of the activities that make up the assessment in a block that is already visible to the student, enabling him to monitor his progress in the course evaluations.

The plugin allows the following actions:

**Select the activities to be displayed in the block:**
In the block settings, the teacher can select, among all the course activities, which will be displayed in the block, and configure how the notes are displayed.

**Show the final note:**
The plugin allows the calculation and display of a final grade, calculated from the selected activities! The calculation possibilities are: Sum, Average or Highest score.

**Show a vision to the student that allows the monitoring of the evaluations that received grade:**
The teacher can configure the display of a check for the student to follow up on the evaluations that have already been given a grade. A progress bar is also displayed showing the percentage of completion of the evaluations. (Only in the student's view)

**A vision for the teacher to monitor the evaluations made by the students:**
The block shows a vision for the teacher, different from that of the student, where it allows the teacher to monitor the number of students who have already carried out each assessment and at the end displays the number of students who have not yet accessed the course.

**Detailed report of the nostas overview for the teacher:**
The teacher can view a detailed report of the overview of the grades, shown according to the configuration made in the Grade Overview block.
